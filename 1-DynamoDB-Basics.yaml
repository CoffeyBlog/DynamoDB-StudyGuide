### DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service for applications that need single digit latency at any scale.

- DynamoDB supports both Document and KeyValue data models
- This flexible data model works well with many use cases such as:
- --Mobile
- --Web
- --Gaming
- --Iot
- --Live Online Voting
- --Session Management
- --Store S3 object metadata

### Serverless
- DynamoDB is serverless so it is scalable with no servers to manage

- No limit on table size or amount of bytes in a table

- Runs on SSD which allows it to achieve millisecond latency

- Fully resilient, highly available and fault tolerant because the data is replicated across 3 geographically unique datacenters

- Data is accessed via an HTTP endpoint, so datacenter failures will be transparent to your app

- DynamoDB's performance scales in a linear way, versus a scaled/tierd manor if you were adding EC2 servers to an RDS DB

- You specify how many reads and writes you want on a table per second and DynamoDB handles the rest

- DynamoDB is fully integrated with IAM - so you can control granular access and security

### Regions
- DynamoDB is a collection of tables in each region - the services namespace is at the region level.

- Availability Zones are not important when dealing with DynamoDB

### Tables
- Tables are at the highest level structure within a Database

- It is on tables that you specify your performance requirements

- Performance units - you specify the amount of reads and writes that you want on each table - if you go above these units, you become throttled

###Write Capability Units
- 1 WCU - write capacity units, the number of 1KB blocks per second to your table
- -- 2 WCU would equal 2KB blocks per second
- -- 3 WCU would equal 3KB blocks per second

###Read Capability Units
- 1 RCU - read capacity units, the number of 1KB blocks per second to your table
- -- 2 RCU would equal 8KB blocks per second
- -- 3 RCU would equal 3KB blocks per second

### DynamoDB supports eventually consistent reads
- DynamoDB is a distributed system, when you write to a table you are writing to multiple locations at one time
- Remember? - DynamoDB data is replicated across 3 distinct datacenters

- When you make a write to DynamoDB it is only acknowledged, at the point that 2 datacenters have responded w/ a confirmed write

- There is a small chance that a read will not show updated write of data if it's partially complete

### Strongly consistent reads
- Strongly consistent reads use 1 read unit per 4kb block whereas eventually consistent reads use .5 units per 4kb block
- You get better performance with strongly consistent reads, but it does cost more

###Billing
- Billing in DynamoDB is done based on the number of WCU's, RCU's and amount of data stored

### Partition - Basics
- Kind of like an underlying server, that can coupe with a certain level of Read / Write Capacity Units and store a certain amount of data

### Tables - Basics
- A table is made up of items (these are like excel rows)
- Each item contains a number of elements
- An item can contain a different number of elements
- Each item can contain a different number of elements or different types of elements
- The individual elements are attributes

- Partition Key / Hash key is a special attribute - that has to be unique in the table in order to identify an item

- Sort Key - used when each occurrence of a partition key, you have multiple data items

### Data Types
- 2 types of data types
- --Scalar
- --DynamoDB

### Attribute types
- --String "Hello"
- --Number 123
- --Binary
- --Boolean true false
- --Null
- --Document (List/Map) - JSON
- --Set ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]

### DynamoDB & Redshift
- Using the copy command in redshift you can copy data directly from Dynamo to Redshift

### DynamoDB & EMR
- DynamoDB is integrated with Apache Hive, by using Hive on EMR you can read and write data in DynamoDB tables
- This allows you to query DynamoDB data with a SQL like language
- You can copy data from DynamoDB to an S3 bucket
- You can copy data from DynamoDB to HDFS
- And you can perform JOIN operations on DynamoDB tables

### DynamoDB & Data Pipeline
- You can move / copy data to and from DynamoDB to S3

### DynamoDB  & Lambda
- DynamoDB is integrated with Lambda so that you can create triggers

### Kinesis & DynamoDB
- You can collect data from Kinesis and store it directly into DynamoDB
